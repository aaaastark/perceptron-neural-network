## Task Perceptron
1. Write code to perform N number of epochs until the loss gets close to zero.

3. Compute the loss after each epcoh using sklearn loss function.

5. Try different values of alpha and see how it affects the training process.

7. Once the perceptron gets trained, test the trained perceptron on testing data and report test accuracy, confusion matrix.
